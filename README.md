This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row. My goal is to investigate whether patients' gender or age has any significant impact on whether they keep the promise (show up at doctor's office as scheduled) or not.
